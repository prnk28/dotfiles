description: Organize and Plan a Milestones
---

Fetch all active issues and milestones in this repository. Assign all issues without a milestone to the appropriate milestone based on estimated time to completion and sequential order of functionality.

## Requirements

- Always update milestone descriptions if they currently do not contain one.
- If a new milestone is required to scope the list of issues continue to create one.
- Milestones should be spaced out every other week based off existing milestones.
- Milestones should always sequentially order work in a way which maximizes functionality of the overall codebase.
- Low priority issues should still be scoped in the necessary milestone for completion.
- When a milestone seems like it cannot be completed by the deadline create or use the next milestone and replan all issues.
