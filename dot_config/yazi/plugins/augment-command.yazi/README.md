| `default_item_group_for_prompt`     | `hovered`, `selected` or `none`       | `hovered` | The default item group to operate on when the prompt is submitted without any value. This only takes effect if `prompt` is set to `true`, otherwise this option doesn't do anything. `hovered` means the hovered item is operated on, `selected` means the selected items are operated on, and `none` just cancels the operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

With this option set, the `enter` and `open` commands will both call the `enter` command when a directory is hovered and call the `open` command when a regular file is hovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `smart_paste`                       | `true` or `false`                     | `false`   | Paste items into a directory without entering it. The behaviour is exactly the same as the [smart-paste tip on Yazi's documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/tips#smart-paste). Setting this option to `false` will use the default `paste` behaviour.

| `sort_directories_first`            | `true` or `false`                     | `true`    | This option tells the plugin if you have sorted directories first in your [`yazi.toml` file](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first), located at `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml` on Linux and macOS or `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml` on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username. If you have set [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first) to `true` in your [`yazi.toml` file](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first), set this option to `true` as well. If you have set [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first) to `false` instead, set this option to `false` as well. This option only affects the `parent-arrow` command with `wraparound_file_navigation` set to `true`. If the [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first) setting doesn't match the plugin's `sort_directories_first` setting, i.e. Yazi's `sort_dir_first` is `true` but the plugin's `sort_directories_first` is `false`, or Yazi's `sort_dir_first` is `false` but the plugin's `sort_directories_first` is `true`, the wraparound functionality of the `parent-arrow` command will not work properly and may act erratically. The default value of `sort_directories_first` follows Yazi's [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first) default value, which is `true`. |

If you would like to use the default configuration, which is shown below,
you don't need to add anything to your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`
file on Linux and macOS, or your
`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua`
file on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username.

```lua
-- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua for Linux and macOS
-- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua for Windows

-- Using the default configuration
require("augment-command"):setup({
    prompt = false,
    default_item_group_for_prompt = "hovered",
    smart_enter = true,
    smart_paste = false,
    enter_archives = true,
    extract_retries = 3,
    must_have_hovered_item = true,
    skip_single_subdirectory_on_enter = true,
    skip_single_subdirectory_on_leave = true,
    ignore_hidden_items = false,
    wraparound_file_navigation = false,
    sort_directories_first = true,
})
```

However, if you would like to configure the plugin, you can add
your desired configuration options to your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` file
on Linux and macOS, or your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua`
file on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username.
You can leave out configuration options that you would like to be left as default.
An example configuration is shown below:

```lua
-- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua for Linux and macOS
-- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua for Windows

-- Custom configuration
require("augment-command"):setup({
    prompt = true,
    default_item_group_for_prompt = "none",
    extract_retries = 5,
    ignore_hidden_items = true,
    wraparound_file_navigation = true,
    sort_directories_first = false,
})
```

## What about the commands are augmented?

All commands that can operate on multiple files and directories,
like `open`, `rename`, `remove` and `shell`,
as well as the new commands `editor` and `pager`,
now determine an item group to operate on.
By default, the command will operate on the hovered item,
unless the hovered item is also selected,
then it will operate on the selected items.

- When `must_have_hovered_item` is set to `true`,
  having no hovered item means the plugin will cancel the operation.
- When `must_have_hovered_item` is set to `false` and
  there are selected items, the selected items will be operated on.
- With `prompt` is set to `true`,
  the plugin will always prompt you to
  choose an item group when there are
  both selected items and a hovered item.

## Augmented commands

### Open (`open`)

- When `smart_enter` is set to `true`,
  it calls the `enter` command when the hovered item is a directory.
- `--no-skip` flag, which only applies
  when `smart_enter` is used as it is passed to the `enter` command.
  More details about this flag can be found at the documentation
  for the [enter command](#enter-enter).
- Automatically extracts and enters archive files,
  with support for skipping directories
  that contain only one subdirectory in the extracted archive.
  This can be disabled by setting `enter_archives` to `false` in the configuration.
  This feature requires the
  [`7z` or `7zz` command](https://github.com/p7zip-project/p7zip)
  to be present to extract the archives.
- If the archive file contains only a single file,
  the command will automatically extract it to the
  current directory instead of creating a folder
  for the contents of the archive.
  If this extracted file is also an archive file,
  the command will automatically
  extract its contents before deleting it.
  This feature requires the
  [`file` command](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/)
  to detect the mime type of the extracted file,
  and to check whether it is an archive file or not.
  This makes extracting binaries from
  compressed tarballs much easier, as there's no need
  to press a key twice to decompress and extract
  the compressed tarballs.

### Enter (`enter`)

- When `smart_enter` is set to `true`,
  it calls the `open` command when the hovered item is a file.
- Automatically skips directories that
  contain only one subdirectory when entering directories.
  This can be turned off by setting
  `skip_single_subdirectory_on_enter` to `false` in the configuration.
- `--no-skip` flag. It stops the plugin from skipping directories
  that contain only one subdirectory when entering directories,
  even when `skip_single_subdirectory_on_enter` is set to `true`.
  This allows you to set a key to navigate into directories
  without skipping the directories that contain only one subdirectory.

### Leave (`leave`)

- Automatically skips directories that
  contain only one subdirectory when leaving directories.
  This can be turned off by
  setting `skip_single_subdirectory_on_leave` to `false`
  in the configuration.
- `--no-skip` flag. It stops the plugin
  from skipping directories that contain only one subdirectory,
  even when `skip_single_subdirectory_on_leave` is set to `true`.
  This allows you to set a key to navigate out of directories
  without skipping the directories that contain only one subdirectory.

### Rename (`rename`)

- The `rename` command is augmented as stated in
  [this section above](#what-about-the-commands-are-augmented).

### Remove (`remove`)

- The `remove` command is augmented as stated in
  [this section above](#what-about-the-commands-are-augmented).

### Paste (`paste`)

- When `smart_paste` is set to `true`,
  the `paste` command will paste items
  into a hovered directory without entering it.
  If the hovered item is not a directory,
  the command pastes in the current directory instead.
  Otherwise, when `smart_paste` is set to `false`,
  the `paste` command will behave like the default
  `paste` command.
- `--smart` flag to enable pasting in a hovered directory
  without entering the directory.
  This flag will cause the `paste` command to paste items
  into a hovered directory even when `smart_paste` is set to `false`.
  This allows you to set a key to use smart paste
  instead of using smart paste for every paste command.

### Shell (`shell`)

- This command runs the shell command given with the augment stated in
  [this section above](#what-about-the-commands-are-augmented). You should
  only use this command if you need the plugin to determine a suitable
  item group for the command to operate on. Otherwise, you should just
  use the default `shell` command provided by Yazi.
- To use this command, the syntax is exactly the same as the default
  `shell` command provided by Yazi. You just provide the command you want and
  provide any Yazi shell variable, which is documented
  [here](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/keymap/#manager.shell).
  The plugin will automatically replace the shell variable you give
  with the file paths for the item group before executing the command.
- You will also need to escape the quotes when giving the shell command
  if you use the same quotes to quote the given arguments to the plugin.
  For example, if you pass the arguments to the plugin with double quotes,
  i.e. `--args="shell"`, you will have to escape the double quotes with a
  backslash character, like shown below:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on = [ "o" ]
  run = 'plugin augment-command --args="shell \"$EDITOR $@\" --block --confirm"'
  desc = "Open the editor"
  ```

- Alternatively, you can use the triple single quote `'''` delimiter
  for the run string and avoid the escaping the shell command altogether,
  like the two examples below:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on = [ "o" ]
  run = '''plugin augment-command --args='shell "$EDITOR $@" --block --confirm''''
  desc = "Open the editor"

  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on = [ "i" ]
  run = '''plugin augment-command --args="shell '$PAGER $@' --block --confirm"'''
  desc = "Open the pager"
  ```

- `--exit-if-directory` flag to stop the shell command given
  from executing if the item group consists only of directories.
  For example, if the item group is the hovered item, then
  the shell command will not be executed if the hovered item
  is a directory. If the item group is the selected items group,
  then the shell command will not be executed if **all**
  the selected items are directories. This behaviour comes
  from it being used in the `pager` command.
  The `pager` command is essentially:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on = [ "i" ]
  run = '''plugin augment-command --args="shell '$PAGER $@' --block --confirm --exit-if-directory"'''
  desc = "Open the pager"
  ```

### Arrow (`arrow`)

- When `wraparound_file_navigation` is set to `true`,
  the arrow command will wrap around from the bottom to the top or
  from the top to the bottom when navigating.
  Otherwise, it'll behave like the default `arrow` command.

## New commands

### Parent-arrow (`parent-arrow`)

- This command behaves like the `arrow` command,
  but in the parent directory.
  It allows you to navigate in the parent directory
  without leaving the current directory.
- When `wraparound_file_navigation` is set to `true`,
  this command will also wrap around from the bottom to the top or
  from top to the bottom when navigating in the parent directory.
  For this feature to work properly, the
  [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first)
  option in your `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml` file on Linux and macOS,
  or your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml`
  file on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username,
  has to match the plugin's `sort_directories_first` option,
  i.e. if you have set the
  [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first)
  to `true` in your `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml` file on Linux and macOS,
  or your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml` on Windows,
  like so:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml on Windows

  [manager]
  sort_dir_first = true
  ```

  Then `sort_directories_first` should be set to `true`
  as well in your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` file on Linux and macOS,
  or your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml`
  file on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username, like so:

  ```lua
  -- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua on Linux and macOS
  -- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua on Windows

  require("augment-command"):setup({
      sort_directories_first = true
  })
  ```

  If your `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml` file on Linux and macOS, or your
  `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml` file on Windows,
  where `USERNAME` is your Windows username, has
  [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first)
  set to `false`, like so:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml on Windows

  [manager]
  sort_dir_first = false
  ```

  Then `sort_directories_first` should be set to `false`
  as well in your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` file on Linux and macOS,
  or your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\yazi.toml`
  file on Windows, where `USERNAME` is your Windows username, like so:

  ```lua
  -- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua on Linux and macOS
  -- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\init.lua on Windows

  require("augment-command"):setup({
      sort_directories_first = false
  })
  ```

  The default value of `sort_directories_first` follows Yazi's
  [`sort_dir_first`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_dir_first)
  default value, which is `true`.

- You can also replicate this using this series of commands below,
  but it doesn't work as well,
  and doesn't support wraparound navigation:

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
  # C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

  # Use K to move up in the parent directory
  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on   = [ "K" ]
  run  = [ "leave", "arrow -1", "enter" ]
  desc = "Move up in the parent directory"


  # Use J to move down in the parent directory
  [[manager.prepend_keymap]]
  on   = [ "J" ]
  run  = [ "leave", "arrow 1", "enter" ]
  desc = "Move down in the parent directory"
  ```

### Editor (`editor`)

- The `editor` command opens the default editor set by the `$EDITOR` environment variable.
- The command is also augmented as stated in
  [this section above](#what-about-the-commands-are-augmented).

### Pager (`pager`)

- The `pager` command opens the default pager set by the `$PAGER` environment variable.
- The command is also augmented as stated in
  [this section above](#what-about-the-commands-are-augmented).
- The `pager` command will also skip opening directories, as the pager
  cannot open directories and will error out.
  Hence, the command will not do anything when the hovered item
  is a directory, or if **all** the selected items are directories.
  This makes the pager command less annoying as it will not
  try to open a directory and then immediately fail with an error,
  causing a flash and Yazi to send a notification.

## Usage

Add the commands that you would like to use to your `keymap.toml` file,
located at `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml` on Linux and macOS
and at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml`
on Windows, in this format:

```toml
# ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
# C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "key" ]
run = "plugin augment-command --args='command arguments --flags --options=42'"
desc = "Description"
```

For example, to use the augmented `enter` command:

```toml
# ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
# C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "l" ]
run = "plugin augment-command --args='enter'"
desc = "Enter a directory and skip directories with only a single subdirectory"
```

All the default arguments, flags and options provided by Yazi are also supported, for example:

```toml
# ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml on Linux and macOS
# C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\keymap.toml on Windows

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "k" ]
run  = "plugin augment-command --args='arrow -1'"
desc = "Move cursor up"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "r" ]
run = "plugin augment-command --args='rename --cursor=before_ext'"
desc = "Rename a file or directory"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "D" ]
run = "plugin augment-command --args='remove --permanently'"
desc = "Permanently delete the files"
```

For the default descriptions of the commands,
you can refer to
[Yazi's `keymap.toml` file](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/blob/main/yazi-config/preset/keymap.toml).

Essentially, all you need to do to use this plugin
is to wrap a Yazi command in single quotes,
like `'enter'`,
then add `plugin augment-command --args=`
in front of it, which results in
`plugin augment-command --args='enter'`.
